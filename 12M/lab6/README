# Programmed in java a Generic List. We recreated the IntegerList
# example that we were given in lecture weeks ago. I decided to use
# a LinkedList implementation for this generic list. This list is
# in that it can be a list of Integers or Strings or Doubles. List
# implements the ListInterface but also overrides the equals and toString methods.
# The methods available to the user are isEmpty, size, get, add,
# remove, removeAll, toString, and equals.
