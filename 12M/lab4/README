# Programmed in C a program to read a file
# allocated memory to store a large array of characters
# split each line of the file into string or character arrays
# those character arrays were then sorted into 4 categories
# alphabetic, numeric, punctuation, and whitespace characters
# the characters were then counted and written into an output file
# once all the lines were read and printed to the output file
# I freed up the allocated memory and closed the files
