# Programmed in C a Dictionary ADT using the LinkedList data Structure
# this data type is identical to the programming assignment 3. Each entry
# in the dictionary contains a key and a value which are character arrays
# not strings (since strings do not exist in C). The methods available are
# newDictionary, freeDicitionary, insert, delete, size, isEmpty, lookup,
# makeEmpty, and printDictionary. Since this ADT is in C and not java,
# I had to manually allocate memory for each variable/object and deallocate
# each variable/object when it is finished being used.
