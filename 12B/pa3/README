# Implemented a Dictionary ADT using a LinkedList structure.
# I used a one directional head node, going in one direction.
# When I add a pair of values (key/value) to the list,
# I insert the node at the end of the list.
# While when I remove, once I know that it is there to remove,
# splice that Node out of the list. That node no longer has ay references to it.
# The previous nodes "next" becomes the next state of the removed Node.
# I also implemented the other methods of the DictionaryInterface class that I was given
