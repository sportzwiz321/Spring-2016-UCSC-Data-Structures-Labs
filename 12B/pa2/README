# Used concepts from lab 2 to search a file given from a file name
# given to me in the command line. I searched and sorted the file
# into an array of strings using merge sort. Then I used a binary
# search to search for "target" strings. I printed out to the
# standard output whether or not the target word was found
# and if it was found, as well as what line it originally appeared on
# in the unsorted list of words file.
