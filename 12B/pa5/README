# Programmed in C a dictionary. We used a hash table implementation
# creating linked lists upon collisions. This lab is similar to a previous
# assignment in that we had to create a dictionary, storing nodes with two
# character array values. The difference of course is the implementation.
# The hash table allows us to randomly place entries into the table by "hashing"
# the "key" character array. The operations available to the user are
# newDictionary(), freeDictionary(), isEmpty(), size(), lookup(),
# insert(), delete(), makeEmpty(), and printDictionary().
